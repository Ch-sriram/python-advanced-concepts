# Python &mdash; Advanced Concepts

This repository is a proof of concept that I know how to read/write code in Python. I will also use this repository to revise some of the harder concepts in Python (like Generators and Decorators). Feel free to contribute to the repository if you feel like there are some concepts that need to be added into the repository.
